MNEMOSYNE CONF FILES
====================+

# Summary
- Last Updated: 2019.06.07
- Updated by: gojun077@gmail.com

> The original path for these files is `~/.config/mnemosyne/`.
> `config.py` contains settings such as the latex preamble which
> specifies latex fonts to use in mnemosyne cards

> `machine.id` is used to identify the machine for card syncing with
> other devices or machines

> `config.db` stores config values of some kind, but I haven't
> accessed this DB yet. It is probably in sqlite3 format like
> `default.db`

> Symlinks are created from `~/dotfiles/mnemosyne-conf/[FILE]` to
> `~/.config/mnemosyne/[FILE]` with the exception of `machine.id`
> which is unique per machine.
