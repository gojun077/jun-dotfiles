# ~/.bash_profile
# for MacOS

#
# Note: MacOS behavior around `.bash_profile` is different from
# that of Linux and other POSIX systems. Normally, `.bash_profile`
# is only executed by the login shell, but `Terminal.app` on MacOS
# runs a login shell by default for each new terminal window, which
# means that in practice `.bash_profile` can be sourced multiple
# times on MacOS.
#
# This `.bash_profile` simply loads `.bashrc` and values which should
# only be run once per session, have been moved to separate bash
# shell scripts that can be sourced manually.
