systemd/environment.d

> Configuration files in the environment.d/ directories contain lists of
> environment variable assignments for services started by the systemd user
> instance. systemd-environment-d-generator(8) parses them and updates the

> It is recommended to use numerical prefixes for file names to simplify

The files in this directory declare environment variables that need to
be available to systemd user services that are launched via
`systemctl start --user <my-user-service>`
